;; emamux-ruby-test makes you test ruby file with emamux.
;; This package is inspired by vimux-ruby-test.
;;
;; To use emamux-ruby-test, add the following code into your init.el or .emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'emamux-ruby-test)
;;
;; emamux-ruby-test provides following commands:
;;
;; Run all tests/specs in the current file
;;     M-x emamux-ruby-test:run-all
;;
;; Run focused test/spec
;;     M-x emamux-ruby-test:run-focused-test
;;
;; Run current context(rspec, shoulda)
;;     M-x emamux-ruby-test:run-focused-context
